# Coding Challenge #1: Temperature Forecast

This coding challenge involves creating a function called `printForecast` to display the forecasted maximum temperatures in a string format. The function will take an array of temperatures as input and print a string representing each temperature along with the number of days until that temperature is forecasted.

## Problem Statement
Given an array of forecasted maximum temperatures, the thermometer should display a string with the given temperatures. For example, if the input array is `[17, 21, 23]`, the output should be "... 17ºC in 1 day ... 21ºC in 2 days ... 23ºC in 3 days ..."

## Tasks
1. Create a function `printForecast` which takes in an array `arr` and logs a string representing the forecasted temperatures to the console. 
2. Use the problem-solving framework to understand the problem and break it up into sub-problems.

## Test Data
- **Data 1**: `[17, 21, 23]`
- **Data 2**: `[12, 5, -5, 0, 4]`

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have a JavaScript environment set up (Node.js or a web browser console).
2. Copy the provided function `printForecast` into your JavaScript environment.
3. Call the `printForecast` function with the test data arrays as arguments.
4. View the output printed to the console.

## Example
```javascript
// Example usage with test data 1
printForecast([17, 21, 23]);
// Output: "... 17ºC in 1 day ... 21ºC in 2 days ... 23ºC in 3 days ..."

// Example usage with test data 2
printForecast([12, 5, -5, 0, 4]);
// Output: "... 12ºC in 1 day ... 5ºC in 2 days ... -5ºC in 3 days ... 0ºC in 4 days ... 4ºC in 5 days ..."
```

## Conclusion
This coding challenge provides an opportunity to practice array manipulation and string formatting in JavaScript. By implementing the `printForecast` function, you'll gain experience in solving algorithmic problems and displaying data in a user-friendly format.

**GOOD LUCK!** 🍀👩‍💻👨‍💻
